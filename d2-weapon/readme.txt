D2-Weapon - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
GitHub: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Weapon
Game version: BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET (tested on v2.5/v2.6)


==================================================
WHAT THIS MOD DOES
==================================================
Adds 11 weapons loosely based on weapons from FromSoft's Dark Souls trilogy, plus 4 others experimenting with various effects. All items are purchased, and get added to various shops. Some of the weapons have more "normal" abilities, while others have very extreme advantages and disadvantages. I tried to give them some interesting abilities that set them apart from weapons in the base games.

Note: For BG1, all items install, but only 1 (Unbalanced Halberd) gets added to stores.


==================================================
INSTALL INFO
==================================================
Extract to game folder and run the setup to install or uninstall. I'm not familiar with Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as other mods (mod packages are cross-platform). Should be installed before any mods that make global changes to weapons, such as weapon usability tweaks.

This mod makes use of names, images, and modified text from various FromSoftware games, including the Dark Souls trilogy and Demon's Souls. Play these games if you haven't. They are, along with Bloodborne, some of the best rpgs released over the past decade (with Bloodborne being the best period).

VERSION HISTORY
==================================================
v1.7
- changed BAM icons for Unbalanced Halberd, Club +4: Frenzy, and Weapon Sack
- IWDEE: added +2 damage bonus to Black Bow of Pharis and lowered THAC0 bonus to +5
- IWDEE: added +3 damage bonus to White Birch Bow
- IWDEE: added +1 damage bonus to Avelyn (not in Repeat Fire mode)
- These bows were really weak in IWDEE, since bows in that game get full damage bonuses from enchantment. These changes just bring them in line with other magical bows.

v1.6.1
- small update to how d2#wbag.itm works; no changes to weapons

v1.6
- movement bonus from Frenzy status (Club +4: Frenzy) now uses the stacking percentage modifier
- Stone Greatsword now uses a custom projectile, the slowdown effect hits slightly faster than before
- revised Sling +2: Accelerator - usable by all races, but only halflings get Accelerator effect
- d2#wbag.ITM: A bag of holding containing all weapons from this mod. It's not obtainable through normal gameplay. Use the console or an editor to add to game if you want to quickly test out the weapons.

- update some things with the installation
- no changes to items
