Avelyn
==================================================
An extremely rare rapid-firing crossbow. Fires bolts in quick succession by means of an elaborate mechanism. Despite its use as a weapon, this crossbow is also a priceless work of art, and requires the use of both hands to operate at all times, inhibiting spellcasting. Unlike other crossbows, the Avelyn requires intelligence to operate proficiently.

A small emblem of a circle containing a lightning bolt can be seen imprinted on the left side of the device. It appears that the inventor had this particular crossbow infused with the powers of lightning. Further inspection reveals an additional function. It is possible to fully unlock the repeating mechanism, and fire bolts of pure electrical energy at a frightening speed and accuracy. This mode can be activated even by classes that do not normally become proficient with crossbows, provided they have the requisite intelligence.

Stone Greatsword
==================================================
A moss-covered greatsword. It is said that these swords were wielded by the stone guardians of an enchanted forest, once the home of powerful sorceries, before the inhabitants awakened the Abyss.

==================================================
Chaos Rapier
==================================================
Rapier of darkness and chaos. Once, a brilliant young sorcerer cast away his earthly desires, devoting himself entirely to the Dark that bewitched him. Nebulous, inky and serene, the Dark holds an allure matched only by the fear it strikes in men's hearts.

One must weigh the benefits of wielding such a weapon. It greatly strengthens fire damage, but exacts a heavy price. For shadow is born from light, and the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow. And the Dark embraces, but which truth does the seeker seek?

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Dark: +3 bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom, -1 penalty to Constitution and Charisma
– Scion of Flame: +50% increase to all sources of fire damage
– Devotion: The wielder takes 3 points of magic damage when equipping this weapon, and an additional 1 point of magic damage every 18 seconds while holding it

Drakeblood Greatsword
==================================================
Greatsword wielded by the Drakeblood Knights, led by the honorable Sir Yorgh. The insignia chiseled upon its hilt symbolizes dragon's blood.

– -2 penalty to Save vs. Death

Bewitched Alonne Sword
==================================================
A long-hilted katana once wielded by a warrior of certain esteem. The man came from the east, became a trusted knight to a once-great king from ages past, then departed long before the king brought his kingdom to ruin, leaving behind only this resplendent sword. The captivating, undulating design serves to enhance this weapon's mystical allure.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +2 bonus to Save vs. Spell

Combat abilities:
– 33% chance target suffers a bleeding wound, taking 5 slashing damage instantly, and an additional 5 damage per round for 5 rounds (no save)

==================================================
Aquamarine Dagger
==================================================
A dagger fitted with aquamarine crystals that shimmer with arcane magic. Engraved with a prayer, perhaps it was a parting gift given to one sent off on great travels, never to return.

A skilled mage or sorcerer may induce the magic of the crystals, creating a fleeting blue crystal blade, lengthy enough to swing as a straight sword. This ability requires a focus of magical energy, and each use drains one memorized spell.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +2 bonus to casting speed

Combat abilities:
– Magic: +1d6 magic damage

Charge abilities:
– Crystal Blade three times per day (costs one memorized spell)
  Special: A blue blade extends from the hilt, striking as a +4 weapon, with a +4 bonus to hit, and dealing 1d4+2 piercing damage, plus an additional 3d6 magic damage. The weapon sets base attacks per round to 3, and THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level as the caster. Proficiency bonuses apply as normal.

==================================================
Unbalanced Halberd (non-magical)
==================================================
Like others of its type, this halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff approximately six feet in length. The weapon appears to be solidly built, though strangely, it costs only a single gold piece and the weight feels odd in your hands, shifting forward or sideways of its own accord.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Each round, the wielder gains +1 or -1 to Strength and Dexterity for 3 rounds (effects are always the opposite for each attribute)

Damage: 1d10 (piercing or slashing)
Speed Factor: 9

Type: Two-handed
Requires:
 13 Strength

Weight: 15

==================================================
Club +4: Frenzy
==================================================
Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end.  This simple weapon has been used since mankind first began using tools.  Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it; hence the club's widespread use. This club has been magically enhanced, and burns with a fierce rage, for things once lost and a destiny once stolen, which can never be sated.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Daze: 25% chance target is confused for 1 round (no save)
– May Enrage as a Berserker three times per day (duration: 1 turn)
– Becomes winded after berserking (5 rounds): -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, and Armor Class

FRENZY: The wielder does not have full control over the weapon-induced rage. While berserking, there is a 15% chance per round to enter a frenzied state, attacking friend and foe alike. While frenzied, the wielder gains +2 to hit and damage, an extra attack per round, doubled movement speed, and a +30% chance to critical hit. Frenzy always lasts for a full turn and the bonuses are in addition to the bonuses from Enrage.

==================================================
Scimitar +2: Accelerator
==================================================
The scimitar is closely related to the saber, a single-edged curved sword with protective hilt. The blade has a greater curve to it and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The origins of the scimitar are largely unknown; however, they have been very popular in the southern region of the realms. This sword has been magically enhanced, and attacks come quicker with each swing of the blade.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Accelerator: Each hit gives the wielder a +0.5 bonus to attacks per round and a -1 THAC0 penalty for 9 seconds

THAC0: +2
Damage: 1d8+2 (slashing)

==================================================
Sling +2: Accelerator
==================================================
Magical slings are the hallmark of stout halfling warriors and adventurers. Anyone can take this sling up and use it as a powerful magical weapon, but the full enchantment emerges when swung by a halfling. Power courses from sling to hand, and the wielder attacks more rapidly with each stone flung from the pocket.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Accelerator: Each hit gives the slinger a +0.5 bonus to attacks per round and a -1 THAC0 penalty for 9 seconds (Halflings only)

THAC0: +2
Damage: +2 (missile)
