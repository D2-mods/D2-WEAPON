# D2-Weapon - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Weapon/releases  
Game version: BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET (tested on v2.5/v2.6)


#### WHAT THIS MOD DOES:

Adds 11 weapons loosely based on weapons from FromSoft's Dark Souls trilogy, plus 4 others experimenting with various effects. All items are purchased, and get added to various shops. Some of the weapons have more "normal" abilities, while others have very extreme advantages and disadvantages. I tried to give them some interesting abilities that set them apart from weapons in the base games.

Note: For BG1, all items install, but only 1 (Unbalanced Halberd) gets added to stores.


#### INSTALL INFO:

Extract to game folder and run the setup to install or uninstall. I'm not familiar with Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as other mods (mod packages are cross-platform). Should be installed before any mods that make global changes to weapons, such as weapon usability tweaks.
