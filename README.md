# D2-Weapon - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Weapon/releases  
Installs on: BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET (v2.5/v2.6)


Overview:
-

This is a mod for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition, and Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition.

Adds 15 weapons, many of them loosely based on weapons from FromSoft's Dark Souls trilogy. All items are purchased from various sellers. Some have more standard abilities, while others have more extreme advantages and disadvantages (though I've toned some of it down in updates).

Note: For BGEE/SoD, all items install, but only 3 are obtainable (2 in SoD).

Components:
-

1. D2-Weapon - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
2. Add damage to bows (recommended for IWD:EE)
3. Add NPC merchant to Throne of Bhaal or Heart of Winter?

Should be installed before any mods that make global changes to weapons, such as weapon usability tweaks.
