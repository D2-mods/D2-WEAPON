# D2-WEAPON - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
GitHub: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-WEAPON  
Forum:  
Game version: BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, untested with non-EE versions


WHAT THIS MOD DOES:

This is a very small Souls-inspired weapon pack. It adds 11 weapons loosely based on weapons from FromSoft's Dark Souls trilogy, plus 4 others experimenting with various effects. All weapons are purchased, and get added to various shops. Some of these weapons have more "normal" abilities, while others have very extreme advantages and disadvantages. I tried to give these weapons some interesting abilities that set them apart from weapons in the base games.

Note: For BG1, all weapons install, but only 1 (Unbalanced Halberd) gets added to stores. But if you want to powergame, I won't stop you from importing and using the stronger weapons.


INSTALL INFO:

Copy zip contents to game directory and run setup-d2-weapon.exe. To uninstall, just run the setup again. Should be installed before any mods that make global changes to weapons, such as weapon usability tweaks. Mod packages are cross-platform, and were made using ALIEN's Infinity Auto Packager. I don't use Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as with other mods.
