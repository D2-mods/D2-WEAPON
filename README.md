# D2-Weapon - A Souls-inspired Weapon Pack
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Weapon/releases  
Game version: BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET (v2.5/v2.6)


#### Overview:

Adds 11 weapons loosely based on weapons from FromSoft's Dark Souls trilogy, plus 4 others experimenting with various effects. All items are purchased. Some have more "normal" abilities, while others have very extreme advantages and disadvantages.

Note: For BG1, all items install, but only 1 (Unbalanced Halberd) gets added to stores.


#### Install info:

Extract to game folder and run the setup to install or uninstall. I'm not familiar with Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as other mods (mod packages are cross-platform). Should be installed before any mods that make global changes to weapons, such as weapon usability tweaks.
